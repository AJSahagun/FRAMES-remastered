    The **Terms of Service (TOS)** govern your registration and use of the system. By creating an account, you agree to comply with these terms, which outline your rights, responsibilities, privacy policies, and limitations of liability.

**Please read carefully before proceeding with registration.** If you disagree, do not use the system. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time, and updates will be reflected here.

### 1. Purpose of FRAMES Registration

The registration process is required to enable access to **FRAMES**, a facial recognition-based access monitoring system. During registration, you will be asked to provide personal information and capture a facial image for the purpose of creating a unique biometric profile for identity verification and access control within the system.

### 2. Data Collection and Use

As part of the FRAMES registration process, we collect and use the following information:

*   **Personal Information**: We may collect basic personal information, including but not limited to your full name, date of birth, email address, and contact details.
*   **Biometric Data**: To create a facial recognition profile, we will capture and process an image of your face using our facial recognition technology. This image, along with related biometric features (e.g., facial landmarks, geometry, distances), will be used exclusively for the purpose of identifying you within the FRAMES system.
*   **Purpose of Data Collection**:
    *   To create your unique biometric profile.
    *   To enable secure, efficient, and accurate identification when accessing authorized areas or systems through FRAMES.
    *   For system maintenance and performance improvements.

By completing the registration, you acknowledge and consent to the collection and use of your personal and biometric data for these purposes.

### 3. Consent

By proceeding with the registration and providing your facial image, you give explicit consent for us to process, store, and use your biometric data for identity verification purposes within the **FRAMES** system.

**Voluntary Participation**: Your participation in the FRAMES registration process is voluntary, but failure to complete registration may limit or prevent your ability to access systems or areas protected by FRAMES.

**Right to Withdraw Consent**: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To do so, please contact our support team at [contact email/phone number]. If you withdraw consent, we will delete your biometric data from the FRAMES system, though this may impact your access to areas or services that rely on biometric verification.

### 4. Data Retention

Your personal information and biometric data will be stored securely for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose of the FRAMES system, including access verification. We will retain your biometric data for no longer than necessary and will securely delete it if you request account deletion or if your access rights are terminated.

**Retention Period**: We may retain your information for as long as your access to the FRAMES system remains active. If your access is revoked or terminated, we will retain your data for a maximum of [X months/years] before securely deleting it.

### 5. Privacy and Security

We take privacy and security seriously. We use industry-standard encryption techniques and other security measures to protect your personal and biometric data during registration, storage, and transmission.

**Data Protection**: Your biometric data will be stored in a secure, encrypted format and will only be accessible to authorized personnel for the purpose of maintaining and operating the FRAMES system.

**Data Access**: Access to your personal and biometric data will be strictly controlled and limited to necessary personnel within the organization who are authorized to manage the system.

### 6. Third-Party Access and Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or lease your biometric or personal data to third parties. However, we may share your data in the following circumstances:

*   **Service Providers**: We may share data with third-party service providers who assist us in operating, maintaining, and improving the FRAMES system. These third parties are required to safeguard your data in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
*   **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your data if required to do so by law, in response to legal processes, or to protect our legal rights or the safety of others.

### 7. User Responsibilities

By registering for FRAMES, you agree to:

*   Provide accurate and complete information during the registration process.
*   Ensure the facial image you provide is clear, well-lit, and accurately represents your face for identification purposes.
*   Notify us promptly if any of your registration details change, including contact information or access privileges.

### 8. Accuracy of Biometric Data

While we strive to ensure the accuracy and security of our facial recognition technology, we cannot guarantee that the system will always function flawlessly. In case of errors or difficulties in your face recognition process, you may contact support for assistance, and we will take reasonable steps to resolve the issue.

### 9. Account Termination and Deletion

If you choose to stop using the FRAMES system, you may request the deletion of your personal and biometric data. This will result in the removal of your face recognition profile from our system, which will effectively revoke your access to areas and systems protected by FRAMES.

**How to Request Deletion**: To request account deletion or the removal of your data, contact our support team at [contact email/phone number]. We will process your request within [X days].

### 10. Changes to Terms

We may update or modify these Terms from time to time. If significant changes are made, you will be notified via email or within the system. By continuing to use FRAMES after such changes are made, you accept and agree to the updated Terms.

### 11. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Philippines, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
