                <p>
                    The registration process is required to enable access to <strong>FRAMES</strong>, 
                    a facial recognition-based access monitoring system. During registration, you will 
                    be asked to provide personal information and capture a facial image for the purpose 
                    of creating a unique biometric profile for identity verification and access control 
                    within the system.

                        capture and process an image of your face using our facial recognition technology. 
                        This image, along with related biometric features (e.g., facial landmarks, geometry, 
                        distances), will be used exclusively for the purpose of identifying you within the 
                        FRAMES system.
